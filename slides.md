<template v-slot:sub-heading>HOLISTIC END TO END REVIEW OF COLLINSON ROUTE TO LIVE:</template>

We mapped the current Route to Live and visualised where Collinson need to be. Then we outlined how to get there, plotting both near-term wins and longer-term strategy.

We then implemented the key near-term interventions, to drive change fast where it mattered most to stabilise the platform. These lighthouse projects delivered concrete results that drove buy-in from the boardroom to the individual engineers.
