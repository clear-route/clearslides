# Clearslides Architecture

This document outlines the architecture for the `clearslides` project, which aims to provide a Slidev-based presentation solution with ClearRoute branding.

## High-Level Architecture

The project will be structured as a standard Slidev project with a custom theme and a set of reusable layouts and components. The architecture is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing for easy customization and maintenance.

## Testing Strategy

The testing strategy will focus on ensuring the quality and correctness of the custom theme, layouts, and components.

- **Unit Tests**: Unit tests will be written for the custom components to ensure that they are working correctly.
- **Integration Tests**: Integration tests will be written for the custom layouts to ensure that they are working correctly with the custom components and styles.
- **Visual Regression Tests**: Visual regression tests will be used to ensure that the styles of the presentation are consistent and do not change unexpectedly.
